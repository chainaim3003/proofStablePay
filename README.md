# ProofStablePay

We are moving in to an era were the blockchain adoption is moving from Speculative only usecases to utility-based usecases coming from institutions.

Stablecoins continue to reshape global payments, but setting up a reliable payment route is more than just tech—it’s about compliance, KYC, and seamless fiat conversions.

## PROBLEM CONTEXT: Stablecoins are Key to drive Blockchain Adoption: Many gaps are yet to be filled to drive adoption


### To drive Real World Utility to Stable coins : We need effective Proofs for Reserves and Delivery Versus Payments


Who are we paying ? What are we paying for ?

Is this a valid  Seller / Vendor / Exporter ?

Beyond just a hash of their documents, but a deep verifiability layer, to drive payment triggers using stablecoins

Is this a Valid Seller / Exporter / Borrowers
At the Account Level
	Is this a Valid Invoice  - At the Asset Level

That triggers payments / escrows 


## The  Solution – ProofPay DvP

### Key Platform Capabilities

Highly Integral ZK Proofs for Tested Proven Integrity Checks ( by Central Banks ) for Risk Assessment and Stress Testing @ Scale : WITH  SMALL AND PREDICTABLE proof sizes for complex off-chain delivery processes that drive stable coin usage.


## ProofPay: For driving StableCoin compliance and adoption
