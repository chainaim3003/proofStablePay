# ProofStablePay

We are moving in to an era were the blockchain adoption is moving from Speculative only usecases to utility-based usecases coming from institutions.

Stablecoins continue to reshape global payments, but setting up a reliable payment route is more than just tech—it’s about compliance, KYC, and seamless fiat conversions. 

Dfns guides to integrate stablecoins into operations.

## PROBLEM CONTEXT: Stablecoins are Key to drive Blockchain Adoption: Many gaps are yet to be filled to drive adoption


### To drive Real World Utility to Stable coins : We need effective Proofs for Reserves and Delivery Versus Payments


Who are we paying ? What are we paying for ?

Is this a valid  Seller / Vendor / Exporter ?

Beyond just a hash of their documents, but a deep verifiability layer, to drive payment triggers using stablecoins

Is this a Valid Seller / Exporter / Borrowers
At the Account Level
	Is this a Valid Invoice  - At the Asset Level

That triggers payments / escrows 


## The  Solution – ProofPay DvP

### KEY PLATFORM CAPABILITIES:

Highly Integral ZK Proofs for Tested Proven Integrity Checks ( by Central Banks ) for Risk Assessment and Stress Testing @ Scale : WITH  SMALL AND PREDICTABLE proof sizes for complex off-chain delivery processes that drive stable coin usage.

### Deep Composition Engine for
Efficient Proofs of Compliance / Recursive Compliance
Deep Integrity of Data - Proof of Business Content, while protecting Privacy / Business-Sensitivity

### Business Process prover for
Proving the off-chain processes that are supposed to happen DID actually happen: Expected Versus Actual

### Risk Management Prover for
Proving to Any Business Party your business terms/regulations are based on your risk management

### Registry – Based on a registry for source of information ( evolution ) for tracking source of data.

The reference Implementation is based on SCF, with closely related compliance use-cases.
